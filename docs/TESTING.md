# TESTING

1. Ensure that diode is placed correctly using multimeter. Should short from GND to PWR.
2. Use a power supply at >=10V, 0.5A to power the board. LEDs should turn on.
3. Lights should dim or brighten based on turns of trimpots.
   1. Right turns increase resistance. Left turns decrease resistance.
4. Use the Blackbody B to measure the irradiance uniformity of every light in a
   dark room. Place the board while running under the centerpoint of each light.
   Measure the light and adjust the resistance of the trimpot to gradually align
   all measurements to a single value.
